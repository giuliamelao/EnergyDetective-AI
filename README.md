# EnergyDetective-AI ⚡
## An AI solution for energy anomaly detection and customer profiling to combat theft and optimize utility services

EnergyDetective-AI is a machine learning solution developed to address critical challenges in the energy sector. This project was created during a hackathon focused on revolutionizing energy management for utility companies. It offers a comprehensive approach to tackling two significant issues: energy theft and customer profiling.


### **Features:**

- **Energy Anomaly Detection:** Our AI model is designed to identify unusual consumption patterns and anomalies in energy usage. By analyzing historical and real-time data, it can flag potential cases of energy theft or wastage.
 - **Customer Profiling:** EnergyDetective-AI uses real-world KPIs provided by Copel, the largest energy company in Parana. This profiling can identify potential 'bad actors' and high-risk customers, enabling utility companies to tailor their services and intervention strategies effectively. By employing actual data from a prominent energy provider, this project empowers utility companies to make more informed decisions regarding customer behavior, energy consumption, and resource allocation.

### **Software Frameworks, Tools, and Libraries:**

 - RRCF (Robust Random Cut Forest)
 - K-Means Clustering
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - Isolation Forest
 - Scikit-Learn
 - RandomForestRegressor
 - NumPy
 - Faker

### **Dataset:**

In this project, we generated synthetic data using the Faker library and integrated genuine KPIs generously shared by Copel, the largest energy company in Parana.
